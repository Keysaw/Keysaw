# Hi there!

My name is Florian PLAMONT, and I'm a French web developer. I strongly believe that programming should be fun, beautiful and rewarding! If I'm not learning something new with each project, then I don't enjoy what I do.

If you're interested in building a modern website with me, feel free to contact me!
